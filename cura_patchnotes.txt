			Should be more in-line with the settings view from 3.6

4.13.0-BETAv1.0:
	Updated main branch to upstream Cura 4.13 work
		Full descriptive patchnotes for this still need to be written
		Lots of changes, including improved stability and a new look

3.6.38: (In-Progress)
	Printer Changes:
		Added the TAZ Pro Long Bed printer
			TAZ Pro with a substantially longer y-axis that allows for seamless long prints.
		Removed the M175v1 Tool Head
			Tool Head's existence was confusing for users, especially since it had it's own slightly altered firmware.
			Anyone with a M175v1 can easily upgrade to a v2, and most if not all already should have.
	Firmware Changes:
		SideKicks firmware updated from 2.0.9.0.10 to 2.0.9.0.14
			Changed default z-offset to -1.23 to reduce chances of the nozzle digging into the bed on first print
		TAZ Pro and TAZ Pro XT updated from 2.0.0.144.7 to 2.0.0.144.8
			Y axis minimum position updated to avoid hitting
	Material Profile Changes:
		Added 2.85mm profiles for SE, HE, HS, and Dual Tool Heads for NinjaTek Armadillo
		Added 1.75mm profiles for Polymaker PolyFlex
		Added some missing Village Plastics ABS profiles on the Workhorse with SE
		Added Polymaker ASA 1.75mm to all 1.75 Tool Heads on all current printers
		Added NinjaTek Cheetah to all currently supported Tool Head/printer combinations
		Added NinjaTek Edge to all currently supported Tool Head/printer combinations
		Added NinjaTek Chinchilla to all 2.85mm Tool Heads with the exception of the SL
			- Chinchilla does not behave well with small nozzles or 1.75mm Tool Heads
			- Due to the difficulty creating high quality print settings on these nozzles, we shall exclude them for now
		Expanded PolyMide PA6 filaments to all current printers with SE, HE, and SK285 Tool Heads
		Expanded Taulman Bridge Nylon filament to the SideKick's SE, HE, and SK285 Tool Heads
		Slightly altered NinjaFlex profiles on HE and Dual Tool Heads for more consistency
		Modified profiles for PolyDissolve S1
			- Default Printing Temp from 220 to 235
			- Printing Temp from 220 to 235
			- Printing Temp Initial Layer from 220 to 235
			- Initial Printing Temp from 215 to 235
			- Final Printing Temp from 215 to 235
			- Build Plate Temp from 45 to 60
			- Build Plate Temp Initial Layer from 55 to 60
			- Support Speed from 45 to 20
			- Support Infill Speed from 45 to 20
			- Support Interface Speed from 45 to 17
			- Support  Roof Speed from 45 to 17
			- Support Floor Speed from 45 to 17
			- Regular Fan Speed from 35 to 15
			- Maximum Fan Speed from 35 to 20
			- Support Overall Angle from 60 to 30
			- Support Density from 20 to 40
			- Support Interface Density from 50 to 80
			- Support Interface Pattern from Lines to Zig Zag

			- Found that the use of the prime tower helps the purging of the filament that sits in the nozzle/heat block
