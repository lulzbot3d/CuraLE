						CURA LULZBOT EDITION PATCHNOTES

4.13.2: [In-Development]
	Changes:
		- Updated default travel speed on Pro Long Bed printers to
			125mm/s as 175mm/s was likely to quick and may have been
			contributing to layer shifts.
		- Changed Horizontal Expansion value from -0.113 back to 0
		- Switched default combing mode back to "Within Infill"
	Fixes:
		- Mini 1 and TAZ Pro Long Bed should now be able to connect

	Fixed a couple of missing gcode files for certain printers
	Added ability to select Bio, TAZ 5, and Mini 1 printers
		- Limited to Legacy Universal Tool Heads on TAZ 5 and Mini 1 for now

	Incrementing version number to Beta v2 to signify a more public release
		- We're getting pretty close to a place we're somewhat comfortable with
	Completely refactored definitions and instance containers for settings
		- Old "codenames" have been nuked
		- In the process of reconfiguring settings to be more sensical
		- Too many settings are still being assigned in quality profiles that
			should be assigned elsewhere

4.13.0-BETAv1.8:
	Added basic material profiles for the Meteor Tool Heads

4.13.0-BETAv1.7:
	Small Patch
		- Fixed issue with firmware flashing to Pro-style printers on Windows
			* During the firmware reset to start the flash, Windows likes to
				move which port the printer is located on and Cura LE would
				lose it, which then prevents the flash from finishing unless
				you would close out and re-open the firmware flashing window.

4.13.0-BETAv1.6:
	Major additions and changes:
		- Reworked material selection to go by material type and then brand
			instead of the other way around
		- Added the ability to mark a machine as having an optional BLTouch,
			this functionality will change what firmware you are provided with.
		- Added both the Asteroid and Meteor Tool Heads and firmware for them.
			Both Tool Heads are experimental at this time, but this will allow
			for those who have been provided kits to more easily flash firmware.
			Material quality settings have not yet been added, we wanted to make
			sure the firmware got out the door ASAP.
		- Patched up the Add Printer screen a little bit to fix a couple bugs.
	Minor changes:
		- Swaped the path that opens when you elect to upload custom firmware
		- Fixed small but in monitor screen regarding the print bed
		- Started work on providing the ability to adjust port and baudrate for a
			printer.

4.13.0-BETAv1.5:
	Major changes:
		- Rework of how printer connections are handled, particularly USB connections
			* Cura LE now creates a USBOutputDevice object when a valid port is
				detected rather than just on establishing a printable connection.
				This allows for easier detection of printer availability for firmware
				flashing purposes along with making the monitor screen more reminiscent
				of the previous version. Ease of use and familiarity are good.
			* Automatic firmware flashing should now actually work, and custom file
				flashing should be more consistent.
			* Wrong printer detection should be *slightly* better than previous,
				but it will still take "Allow connections to wrong printers"
				setting into account on failures. This will continue to be improved
				but is not a focus at the moment.
			* Compatability with the OctoPrint plugin is slightly buggy. We would like
				to better integrate this plugin in the future along with cleaning
				things up so that other output device plugins of a similar vein also
				function cleanly. It would imply that our system is relatively compatible
				with upstream Cura in this regard.

		Reimplemented Custom Supports plugin

3.6.40:
	Printer Changes:
		Added the TAZ Pro Long Bed printer
			TAZ Pro with a substantially longer y-axis that allows for seamless long prints.
		Removed the M175v1 Tool Head
			Tool Head's existence was confusing for users, especially since it had it's own slightly altered firmware.
			Anyone with a M175v1 can easily upgrade to a v2, and most if not all already should have.
		Added the BLTouch add-on for Pro and ProXL
			Allows customers to flash firmware for Pro and ProXL printers equipped with BLTouches
	Firmware Changes:
		SideKicks firmware updated from 2.0.9.0.10 to 2.0.9.0.14

		Added NinjaTek Chinchilla to all 2.85mm Tool Heads with the exception of the SL
			- Chinchilla does not behave well with small nozzles or 1.75mm Tool Heads
			- Due to the difficulty creating high quality print settings on these nozzles, we shall exclude them for now
		Expanded PolyMide PA6 filaments to all current printers with SE, HE, and SK285 Tool Heads
		Expanded Taulman Bridge Nylon filament to the SideKick's SE, HE, and SK285 Tool Heads

		Updated splash screen
		Removed lines from start gcodes regarding backlash compensation
