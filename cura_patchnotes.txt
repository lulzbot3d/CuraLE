CURA LULZBOT EDITION PATCHNOTES
This file is a work-in-progress; some sections may be incomplete, especially older versions. Older version patch notes may be added over time. The file will be updated as
new versions are released and will continue to be utilized as the project progresses.

4.13.0-BETAv1.6:
	Major additions and changes:
		- Reworked material selection to go by material type and then brand instead of the other way around
		- Added the ability to mark a machine as having an optional BLTouch, this functionality will change
			what firmware you are provided with.
		- Added both the Asteroid and Meteor Tool Heads and firmware for them. Both Tool Heads are experimental
			at this time, but this will allow for those who have been provided kits to more easily flash firmware.
			Material quality settings have not yet been added, we wanted to make sure the firmware got out the door
			asap.
		- Patched up the Add Printer screen a little bit to fix a couple bugs.
	Minor changes:
		- Swaped the path that opens when you elect to upload custom firmware
		- Fixed small but in monitor screen regarding the print bed
		- Started work on providing the ability to adjust port and baudrate for a printer.

4.13.0-BETAv1.5:
	Major changes:
		Rework of how printer connections are handled, particularly USB connections
			- Cura LE now creates a USBOutputDevice object when a valid port is detected rather than
				just on establishing a printable connection. This allows for easier detection of printer
				availability for firmware flashing purposes along with making the monitor screen more
				reminiscent of the previous version. Ease of use and familiarity are good.
			- Automatic firmware flashing should now actually work, and custom file flashing should be
				more consistent.
			- Wrong printer detection should be *slightly* better than previous, but it will still take
				"Allow connections to wrong printers" setting into account on failures. This will continue
				to be improved but is not a focus at the moment.
			- Compatability with the OctoPrint plugin is slightly buggy. We would like to better integrate
				this plugin in the future along with cleaning things up so that other output device plugins
				of a similar vein also function cleanly. It would imply that our system is relatively compatible
				with upstream Cura in this regard.
	Additions:

	Additions:
		Reimplemented the OctoPrint plugin
		Reimplemented Custom Supports plugin
		Altered rotation tool to allow typing in accurate rotation angles
		Added back in "Scale to Max" button
			Button does not function exactly as expected as present, but appears to work
			the same as it did in 3.6. This will be looked at again.

		Fixed broken quality profiles for NinjaFlex Edge on M175v2 Tool Heads

4.13.0-BETAv1.1:
	Changes:
		Changed default settings view to use Advanced settings instead of Basic
			Should be more in-line with the settings view from 3.6

4.13.0-BETAv1.0: (4.13 Features branch off from 3.6 after 3.6.37. Some settings may be slightly different)
	Updated main branch to upstream Cura 4.13 work
		Full descriptive patchnotes for this still need to be written
		Lots of changes, including improved stability and a new look

3.6.40:
	Printer Changes:
		Added the TAZ Pro Long Bed printer
			TAZ Pro with a substantially longer y-axis that allows for seamless long prints.
		Removed the M175v1 Tool Head
			Tool Head's existence was confusing for users, especially since it had it's own slightly altered firmware.
			Anyone with a M175v1 can easily upgrade to a v2, and most if not all already should have.
		Added the BLTouch add-on for Pro and ProXL
			Allows customers to flash firmware for Pro and ProXL printers equipped with BLTouches
	Firmware Changes:
		SideKicks firmware updated from 2.0.9.0.10 to 2.0.9.0.14
			Changed default z-offset to -1.23 to reduce chances of the nozzle digging into the bed on first print
		TAZ Pro and TAZ Pro XT updated from 2.0.0.144.7 to 2.0.0.144.8
			Y axis minimum position updated to avoid hitting
		Added TAZ Pro and TAZ Pro XT BLTouch firmware
	Material Profile Changes:
		Added 2.85mm profiles for SE, HE, HS, and Dual Tool Heads for NinjaTek Armadillo
		Added 1.75mm profiles for Polymaker PolyFlex - Fixed broken file name references for a couple 2.85 quality profiles
		Added some missing Village Plastics ABS profiles on the Workhorse with SE
		Added Polymaker ASA 1.75mm to all 1.75 Tool Heads on all current printers
		Added NinjaTek Cheetah to all currently supported Tool Head/printer combinations
		Added NinjaTek Edge to all currently supported Tool Head/printer combinations
		Added NinjaTek Chinchilla to all 2.85mm Tool Heads with the exception of the SL
			- Chinchilla does not behave well with small nozzles or 1.75mm Tool Heads
			- Due to the difficulty creating high quality print settings on these nozzles, we shall exclude them for now
		Expanded PolyMide PA6 filaments to all current printers with SE, HE, and SK285 Tool Heads
		Expanded Taulman Bridge Nylon filament to the SideKick's SE, HE, and SK285 Tool Heads
		Slightly altered NinjaFlex profiles on HE and Dual Tool Heads for more consistency
		Modified profiles for PolyDissolve S1

			- Printing Temp from 220 to 235
			- Printing Temp Initial Layer from 220 to 235
			- Initial Printing Temp from 215 to 235
			- Final Printing Temp from 215 to 235
